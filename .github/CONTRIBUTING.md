We don't have many contributing guidelines for now. 

- Feel free to contribute and if I like your new feature request, or if you fixed a bug, which was on the issue panel, I'll be sure to merge it into the project.

- Make sure it doesn't mess up anything on the website

- If it fixes a feature or bug, please mention Fixes # (mention issue number) because that will save my time.


- Also, please note, that if you don't want to do local testing for your edits in HTML, JS (preferably not), I've hooked up a system, so you just need to make a PR, and Netlify (my hosting service) will give you a special deploy link with all the changes you made in the PR in the custom link.

Thanks,

Kendall Does Coding
